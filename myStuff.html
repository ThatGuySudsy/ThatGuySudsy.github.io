      <h2>The Confirm Button Game</h2>
      <p>A short little game I made completely in HTML and CSS to reteach it to myself. It is inspried by my friend's <a href="https://npminstallsnack.github.io/login-game/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Login Game</a> and the games on <a href="https://neal.fun/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neal.fun</a>, the <a href="https://neal.fun/password-game/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Password Game</a> and <a href="https://neal.fun/not-a-robot/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm not a robot</a>. It is very unoptimized as there is no JavaScript in it.</p>

      <h2>The Symbols of Babel</h2>
      <p>A Python program that creates different black and white 16x16 "symbols". You can see a random one, enter an id, or go in a sequence of every symbol. There are over 1*10<sup>77</sup> unique combinations. Everything is displayed in the terminal.</p>

      <h2>Walk the Console</h2>
      <p>A mini platformer game written in python that displays completely in the terminal. It is pretty bad and was mostly a test for later "console games" that I have made. I haven't yet finished another console game, but improved at making them since making this, and will probably finsih one of them up soon.</p>

      <h2>Minesweeper in the Console</h2>
      <p>Minesweeper that displays completely in the console. It has every feature other than a timer and the feature that in the real game your first click will automatically be a zero.</p>
