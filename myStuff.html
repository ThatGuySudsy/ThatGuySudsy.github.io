      <h2>The Symbols of Babel</h2>
      <p>A Python program that creates different black and white 16x16 "symbols". You can see a random one, enter an id, or go in a sequence of every symbol. There are over 1*10<sup>77</sup> unique combinations. Everything is displayed in the terminal.</p>

      <h2>Walk the Console</h2>
      <p>A mini platformer game written in python that displays completely in the terminal. It is pretty bad and was mostly a test for later "console games" that I have made. I haven't yet finished another console game, but improved at making them since making this, and will probably finsih one of them up soon.</p>
